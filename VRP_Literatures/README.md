To my best knowledge, the existed methods for solving VRP and its variants can be divided into three big categories
- Exact algorithms
- Heuristics (including constructive, improvement and metaheuristics)
- Machine learning

All three approaches are still active and new works are carried out every year. 

In order to have a brief overview, they are arranged as a sequence according to the timeline.
