# Automatic-algorithm-design-Literatures

There are four kinds of referenced materials (four subfolders):
- Books
- Papers
- Slides
- Others

They are formatted according to some rules:
- there is a brief overview on the root directory of each subfolder
- the main ideas and relations of literatures are summarized and listed
- for each work, the main contribution, experiments, conclusions are listed
